# Front-end Imóvel Guide

This is a Front-end Technical Test. It is intended to demonstrate skills.

## Challenge

O Teste Técnico Back-End consiste na construção de CRUD, aonde será feito login, cadastro, atualização de dados, delete e busca de informações, usando chaves de autorização, criptografia e descriptografia de senha.

### Technologies used

- `@nestjs/config`
- `@nestjs/jwt`
- `@prisma/client`
- `@types/passport-jwt`
- `react-icons`
- `class-validator`
- `prisma`
- `typescript`
- `nest.js`

NPM package management was used.


### Commands to Run the Project


To use a mock API and to access the data that will feed the project and run it, do the following:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your machine: [https://github.com/monique282/Txai-Back](https://github.com/monique282/Imovel-Guide);
2. In another terminal, run the `npm install` command to install all libraries.
5. Use the .env.example file to create the .env .
6. Then run the command `npx prisma migrate dev`, which will create the tables and upload all the data
7. Run the `npm run start` command to run the project. This command provides a link that you can open in your browser to interact with the project.

```
Remembering, all the commands above must be given in the folder that corresponds to the project.
For the complete project to work you need Front-end too, which is in the repository https://github.com/monique282/Txai-front

```
